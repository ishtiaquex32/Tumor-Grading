# Topological Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Grading

Official anonymous implementation accompanying our IEEE BIBM submission.

---

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of our framework for binary glioma grading from multi-parametric MRI by integrating Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with multiple deep learning backbones through late feature fusion.

The framework consists of:

- Topological Data Analysis (TDA) feature extraction
- Radiomics feature extraction
- Four deep learning backbones
- Four TDA-based late fusion models

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <anonymous_repository_url>

cd repository
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Dataset

The repository is designed for multi-parametric MRI data consisting of four MRI sequences:

- T1
- T1-contrast
- T2
- FLAIR

The code has been developed and evaluated on two independent glioma datasets:

- UCSF-PDGM
- UTSW Glioma

Users should update the corresponding dataset paths in the configuration files.

---

## Configuration

All experiment settings are located in the `configs/` directory.
